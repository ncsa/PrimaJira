Fill out the fields specified in *login_sample* and rename the file to *login*. Check the activities to be exported in NCSA's Primavera. Run *main.py*.

## activity_complete.py
Goes through activities, finds their corresponding Epics and checks the Started/Finished checkboxes depending on the Epics' completion.

## diff.py
Compares Primavera and JIRA instances specified in the *login* file for inconsistencies, alerts the user and suggests further action.

## excel_to_primavera.py
Creates Activities and Steps within them from an excel file named input.xlsx.

## jira_lync.py

## jira_to_primavera.py
Go through Epics referenced in Primavera Activities and check if all of their Stories are linked in Primavera. If not, attempt to find a good match and write that Story ticket ID to corresponding Activity.
